The data that is being used here for the calculator application comes in the integer and rational class of numbers.

Integer --
An integer is the number zero (0), a positive natural number (1, 2, 3, etc.) or a negative integer with a minus sign (−1, −2, −3, etc.). The negative numbers are the additive inverses of the corresponding positive numbers. In the language of mathematics, the set of integers is often denoted by the boldface Z or blackboard bold Z.

Rational --
In mathematics, a rational number is a number that can be expressed as the quotient or fraction p/q of two integers, a numerator p and a non-zero denominator q. For example,  −3 / 7 is a rational number, as is every integer (e.g. 5 = 5/1). The set of all rational numbers, also referred to as "the rationals", the field of rationals or the field of rational numbers is usually denoted by boldface Q,

NOTE: Rigorous testing has been carried out using by giving integer as an input. Decimals can be a result of some division operation, which also specifies that decimals are allowed as an input.
